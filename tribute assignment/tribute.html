            Imran Khan, born on October 5, 1952, in Lahore, Pakistan, is one of the most prominent figures in the
            country’s history. Educated at Aitchison College and later at Oxford University, he first rose to fame as an
            exceptional cricketer. His talent, discipline, and leadership took Pakistan to its greatest sporting victory
            — winning the 1992 Cricket World Cup. This achievement made him a national hero and a symbol of pride for
            Pakistan. Known for his determination and charisma, Imran’s success in cricket laid the foundation for his
            later roles as a philanthropist and political leader.

        <p class="para">
            After retiring from cricket, Imran Khan devoted himself to social work and philanthropy. Inspired by his
            mother’s battle with cancer, he established the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital in 1994, providing
            free or affordable treatment to thousands of patients. He also founded Namal University to offer higher
            education opportunities to underprivileged students. These projects reflected his deep concern for the poor
            and his belief in using his fame for public good. Through his efforts, Imran earned widespread respect as a
            humanitarian dedicated to improving lives in Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            In 1996, Imran entered politics by founding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, with the goal of
            fighting corruption and promoting justice. Although his political journey was slow and filled with
            challenges, his message of change eventually gained strong public support. In 2018, PTI won the national
            elections, and Imran Khan became Pakistan’s 22nd Prime Minister. During his tenure, he focused on welfare
            programs, poverty reduction, and building a self-reliant economy. Despite political controversies and his
            removal from office in 2022, Imran Khan remains one of Pakistan’s most influential leaders — a man who made
            a lasting mark in sports, charity, and politics.
