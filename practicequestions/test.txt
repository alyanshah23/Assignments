question 1
answer:  we will put a condtion when number of iteration is unknown. while loop will run automatically until the condition is true and stops when condition is fasle. for will run forever 


question 2
answer: we have wrote the wrong condtion in for loop for example 
(for let i = 0; i >= 10 ; i--)
 increment(++) instead of writing decrement(--) or using "> <" wrongly 

question 3
answer: if var is used aleready somewhere else globally loop will not work properly  

question  4
answer: continue is used to skip a specific value in a loop
break is used to stop at specific value like: 1 to 10 and loop will stop on 3  if break is used there.

question 5 
answer: reassining of let can give the result "undefined"

question 6
answer: 

question 7 
answer: using if-else is for complicated situations 
using switch is a better thing because it reduces the code and it is simple than if-else in menu program 

question 8
answer: this cause errors because variable is already declared and has a global scope if it used again program will crash

question 9
answer: for is used for known iterations 
while is used for unknown iterations. for loop don't uses condition
while loop uses conditions. loop is used to save time and reduce code.   

question 10
answer: loop reduces the code. 
loop saves time. 
execution of code will be faster.
loop can be used repeatedly.
